    <div class="content_text">
        "Cookies" are small text files that allow Web sites to store and retrieve information about you from your
        computer system. Mc-Pherson-Gallery does serve cookies to track individual site usage for later aggregation.
        But we do not use cookies in order to retrieve any information from your computer other than information originally
        sent in a Milestone Communications Inc. cookie, such as a user code. We have no control over whether and how our
        advertisers use cookies that originate from their Web site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your
        browser permits, but you may not be able to take full advantage of our site's features, and we recommend that
        you leave them turned on.
        <br/><br/>
        IP address tracking: All computers and servers on the Internet use IP addresses to recognize and communicate
        with
        each other. We collect IP addresses to administer and analyze our site and report aggregate, non-personal
        information (such as how many visitors we have). When you call up our site on your computer, our servers enter
        the
        IP address of that computer into a log. To maintain our users' anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with
        records containing personal information.
        <br/><br/>
        We do not and cannot use cookies or IP address tracking to retrieve personal information from your computer.
